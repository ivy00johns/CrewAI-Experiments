**Website Design Task**

**Client Description:**
I want a basic "Hello World" example website with a but red button that says "Launch".

**Your Role:** UI/UX Designer

**Objective:** Create a visually appealing and user-friendly design concept for the website. Consider the target audience, website goals, and overall user experience.

**Deliverables:**
* Low-fidelity wireframes or sketches outlining the website layout and structure.
* High-fidelity mockups showcasing the visual design, including colors, typography, and imagery.
* A brief explanation of your design choices and how they address the client's needs and user experience considerations.


> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...

* I will start by brainstorming with the client to better understand their needs and expectations for the website. I will ask clarifying questions and gather more information about the target audience, website goals, and overall user experience.
* Once I have a clear understanding of the client's requirements, I will begin designing wireframes and mockups of the website layout and structure. I will use Figma or Adobe XD to create low-fidelity wireframes that show the basic layout and structure of the website.
* After creating the low-fidelity wireframes, I will move on to creating high-fidelity mockups that include visual elements such as colors, typography, and imagery. I will use these mockups to show the client a more detailed version of the website design.
* I will also provide an explanation of my design choices and how they address the client's needs and user experience considerations. This will help ensure that the website is both visually appealing and user-friendly, and meets the client's expectations.
