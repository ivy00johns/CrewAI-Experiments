### TO-DO
- [ ] Read from a .txt file that contains a list of YouTube URLs.
	- [ ] When it completes the download mark it as COMPLETE.
	- [ ] Ignore all COMPLETE videos in future requests.
- [ ] Add the ability to navigate YouTube Playlists and download the transcripts of all included videos.
- [ ] Add logic to scrape [Archive.org](https://archive.org/search?query=dungeons+and+dragons&and%5B%5D=mediatype%3A"texts") since there is a LOT of content.
