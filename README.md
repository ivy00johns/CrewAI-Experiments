# CrewAI Playground
## Purpose
This is my first project using the `CrewAI` framework. In this repo I have a number of example projects.
The code quality won't be the best at I am new to Python.

## Projects
1. **Shapes**
    * This is the 1st project I worked on to test out `CrewAI`.
        * It is setup to generate a website that has displays a designated number of shapes.
        * It contains a start/stop/reset button that will cause the shapes to randomly bounce around the page.
2. **Custom Developer**
    * This is the 2nd project I am working on to create a set of agent developers that takes custom requests.
    * After that phase I want to update it to interate the existing code it generates for future requests.
3. **Dungueon Master**
    * This project will focus on gathering the necessary resources to finetune an LLM to act as a Dungeoun Master Assistant for DnD.
        * It will scrap YouTube videos for transcripes of DnD games, tips/tricks videos for DMs.
